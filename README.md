# Example Logistic Regression

I can do logistic regression and so can you (if you follow along)!

In this repo, I’ll be working through an example logistic regression
problem, while mostly following along with Frank Harrell’s [R workflow
book](https://hbiostat.org/rflow/) which I’ve been meaning to read for a
while. I’ll also take some inspiration from these books:

- Hosmer DW, Lemeshow S. Applied Logistic Regression. New York: Wiley;
  2000.
- Kleinbaum DG, Klein M. Logistic Regression: A Self-Learning Text. New
  York: Springer; 2010.

## Data

For my analyses, I’ll be using data from [this
paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4988630/), which is
open access and thus available online.

> Darton TC, Jones C, Blohmke CJ, et al. Using a Human Challenge Model
> of Infection to Measure Vaccine Efficacy: A Randomised, Controlled
> Trial Comparing the Typhoid Vaccines M01ZH09 with Placebo and Ty21a.
> PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016;10(8):e0004926. Published 2016 Aug 17.
> doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0004926

## Other Resources

In general I like to use in-text citations or footnotes whenever I
reference something, so you don’t just have an ambiguous list of
references. But I’ll also try to keep a general list here.
