As usual, the first thing we need to do is **import and wrangle** our data
into a nice format.

**Steps for this section**
1. Acquire data of interest.
1. Read the data into `R`.
1. Clean up and wrangle the data into a form suitable for analyses.
1. Check for data quality issues and formulate a plan to deal with them. (Such
as missing data and duplicates that I consider a separate issue from formal
EDA.)
1. Document the data (if not already done).

Of course, a lot of these steps will be iterative and require a lot of
intermediate quality checking. So it isn't strictly a numbered list, but
that's the order I plan to discuss the steps.


I'm not usually a fan of a lot of introductory content, so let's go ahead
and jump in!
